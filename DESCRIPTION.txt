Project Description (approx. 300 words):

This project provides a practical starting point for predicting residential house prices in Mumbai using a neural network implemented in MATLAB. The included script performs robust data loading and preprocessing: it attempts fuzzy matching of column names to accommodate dataset variations, converts the Location field to categorical one-hot vectors, and supports latitude/longitude storage if present. Numerical features and the target price are normalized before training to improve convergence. The model architecture is intentionally lightweight — two hidden fully connected layers with ReLU activations followed by a regression output — so it trains quickly while still capturing basic non-linearities. Training uses the Adam optimizer with configurable epochs and batch size.

After training, the script prompts the user interactively for location, area (square footage), bedrooms, and bathrooms, finds the closest matching location if the user input differs, and predicts a house price which is denormalized and formatted in Indian currency units (Lakhs/Crores). A geoscatter map visualization is provided to show the approximate property location. The repository also includes guidance for next steps (feature engineering, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and conversion to Python/TensorFlow for deployment). This repo is intended for experimentation and education; users should validate and improve the model before using predictions for decisions.
